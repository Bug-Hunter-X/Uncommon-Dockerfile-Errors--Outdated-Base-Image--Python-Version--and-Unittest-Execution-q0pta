This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles, namely using an outdated base image and not specifying a Python version.  The `unittest` command may also fail if the project directory isn't structured correctly.

The `Dockerfile` shows the original, flawed code. The `DockerfileFixed` shows the corrected version.

**Problem:**
*   The `ubuntu:latest` image is generally discouraged because it can change unpredictably between updates. A specific version should always be used.
*   `python3` is not a specific version; there could be issues with compatibility.
*   `CMD ["python3", "-m", "unittest", "discover"]` could fail if test files aren't in the expected location relative to the working directory.

**Solution:**
*   Use a specified Ubuntu version (e.g., `ubuntu:22.04`)
*   Use a specific Python version (e.g., `python3.10`).
*   Adjust the `WORKDIR` or file structure to ensure tests are discovered correctly by `unittest discover`.
